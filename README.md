# HybridFactorizationMachines
HybridFactorizationMachines is an algorithm that uses semantic features, coming from knowledge graphs, to initialize latent factors in Factorization Machines.  

## Credits
This algorithm has been developed by Vito Walter Anelli and Joseph Trotta while working at [SisInf Lab](http://sisinflab.poliba.it) under the supervision of Tommaso Di Noia.
